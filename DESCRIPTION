Title: Transcriptome CutUTR
Description: Various mRNA sequencing library preparation methods generate 
    sequencing reads from the transcript ends. Quantification of isoform usage 
    can be improved by using truncated versions of transcriptome annotations 
    when assigning such reads to isoforms. This implements some convenience 
    methods for readily generating such truncated annotations and their 
    corresponding sequences.
